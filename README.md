# TodoList

A To-Do Task List App built using Angular allows users to efficiently manage their daily tasks. This app provides a clean and intuitive interface where users can add, edit, and delete tasks. It supports task prioritization and categorization, enabling users to organize their tasks effectively. The app may include features like due dates, task reminders, and status updates (e.g., completed or pending). With Angular's powerful two-way data binding and modular architecture, the app ensures a responsive user experience and smooth performance, making it an ideal tool for personal productivity.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
